## General Information
Construction calculator for houses and apartments from the developers of CodART.PRO is an application that will allow you to quickly find out the required amount, as well as the cost of materials for decoration or construction, without contacting construction firms, you can also now convert and calculate the perimeter of figures.
The application can work without the Internet, which is the most convenient during use.

And more than 120+ calculations have already been developed and we will add more!

- Foundations and concrete - now you yourself can calculate how many cubes of concrete you need for the required type of foundation.

  - Calculation of the foundation slab
  - Calculation of the strip foundation
  - Calculation of a strip foundation with two sections
  - Calculation of a strip foundation with 3 sections

  - Calculation of brick walls
  - Calculation of walls from blocks
  - Calculation of walls from blocks according to their dimensions

- Finishing and materials - in this section you can independently calculate what is needed for interior decoration, 
for example: tiles, skirting boards, the amount of insulation, flooring, lining, paint, tile adhesive, etc.

  - Amount of insulation for walls and foundations
  - Calculation of flooring from planks / slabs
  - Calculation of the number of tiles
  - Calculation of flooring
  - Calculation of the number of lining on the surface
  - Consumption of primer
  - Paint consumption
  - Consumption of plaster
  - Consumption of putty

- Calculation of coverage for the roof - by choosing the type and specifying the dimensions of the roof, you can easily calculate the required amount of coverage.

  - Shed roof
  - Gable roof

- Earthworks - during work, it is important to calculate the volume that will need to be performed for vertical walls, slopes or calculating a pillow of bulk materials.

  - Calculation of a pillow made of bulk materials
  - Extent of excavation (vertical walls)
  - Amount of excavation (slope)

- Converters - allow you to convert calculations into a form convenient for you.
